# better-faraday

A gem extending Faraday (popular Ruby HTTP client) with useful features without breaking anything.

The only intended difference between this fork and the original is to extend into support ActiveSupport 7.1.x (if not all of 7.x)

## Ruby before 2.5

Please, add `backport_yield_self` to your dependencies.
